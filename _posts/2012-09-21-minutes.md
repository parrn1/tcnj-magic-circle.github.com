title: Meeting Minutes - Playtime

### Playtesting
Yesterday's meeting was one big playtesting party!  After a quarter of an hour to finish development, everyone was able to play [each other's games](http://tcnj-magic-circle.github.com/news/2012-09-14-minutes/).  We had a lot of fun, and the success of the games was satisfying for everyone involved.

### Long Term Projects
It's time to start thinking long-term; next week marks the start of the semester-long (or year-long) projects!  The best ideas will attract people who will be able to make the games a reality (or a prototype of a reality) over the next few months.
