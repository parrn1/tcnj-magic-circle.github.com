Today's meeting consisted of a brief introduction to the club.  The "magic circle" is the concept of a boundary that separates the world of a game from the outside world.  The aim of the club is to help students follow their interest in game design and development.  We went around the room introducing ourselves with our most recent completed game.

### Twine

[Twine](http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) is a utility to create interactive stories that can be played in a web browser.  We introduced the basic concepts in Twine and made a small sample game, "[Bear](http://www.mrconservative.com/files/2013/04/bear.jpg)[Shark](http://moviewriternyu.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/shark.jpg)[John](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2oMiYBqiNNY/Tm6pNMHeaTI/AAAAAAAAAEU/mm_tULhvLVI/w400-h399-no/johnkuiphoff.jpg)".  We will be working with Twine over the next couple of weeks, so if you haven't installed it on your machine please do so.

### IGDA Demo Night

The local [International Game Developers Assocation](http://www.igda.org/) group holds demo nights every month in Hoboken for students and independent developers to showcase their work.  We are planning to take a trip to the next meeting, which will be a Tuesday night in early October (it would take the place of a regular meeting).
