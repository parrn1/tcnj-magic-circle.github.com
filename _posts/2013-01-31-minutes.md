### Global Game Jam
Everyone had a great time at the Global Game Jam last weekend.  The students and alumni produced a solid set of games, from [music gathering](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/artbeats) to [coercing kindergarteners to throw themselves into a volcano](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/ixtlilxochitl-johnson-servant-tlaloc-and-substitute-teacher).  The full list of games can be found [here](http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2013/college-new-jersey/games).

### One Game A Month
The [One Game A Month](O) project is an effort to empower game developers with the reasons and tools for doing what they love.  Simply, the goal is to submit one completed game each month.  It can be anything that's even remotely considered a game, as long as it's finished in the current month.  The E-board is already working on their February submissions, and everyone else should join in, too!

### HTML5 Game Development
Udacity is offering a course in [HTML5 Game Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255), open for anyone to take.  The course is led by a Googler, and explores the technologies needed to build an effective game using web technologies.  Only minimal experience with the web is required; anyone who's programmed before should be okay to take this course.

### Spring Activities Fair
The TCNJ Spring Activities Fair is February 7th (Thursday) from 12-3PM.  We need people to show up at the Magic Circle booth and help us get the word out!  If you have time, please stop by.

### GUILT
The Guilt group, led by Patrick D'Errico, has finished the planning stage of their game.  They aim to have something working by the end of the semester.  Let's show our support for the only Magic Circle group to take on a year-long project!
