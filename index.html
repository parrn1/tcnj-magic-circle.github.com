    <p>Magic Circle was created before the IMM department had an official Games class.  Many students came together wishing to learn more about game development, and so they started this club</p>
    <p>The <strong>Magic Circle</strong> describes the psycological and physiological state a player is in while a game is in progress; a 'seperate reality'.</p>

      <p>Of course! Our member base is not limited to any one career goal. 
	We need the talents of people from all disciplines to collaborate on our projects.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>No! We are interested in all sorts of games, from board games and card games to alternate-reality games and video games.</p>
