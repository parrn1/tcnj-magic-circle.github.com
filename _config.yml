- title: Global Game Jam 2014
  desc: |
    <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">The Global Game Jam</a> (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in todayâ€™s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games.  Magic Circle will be hosting a GGJ site at TCNJ.

- title: GUILT
  desc: |
    The player character is a bystander in the game world. By simply playing, the character witnesses things that are outside of their control. In fact, the character's presence alone can cause horrible events to occur. You may have a few choices throughout the game, but in the end, they are pointless.

- title: Publicist
  name: Steve Boyland
  bio: |
    After stumbling into the very first Magic Circle meeting in Spring 2010 expecting free snacks (there were none), Steve has despite all odds stuck around to become the club Publicist for the second year in a row. A graphic designer and artist by trade, Steve keeps busy not doing any of that and browsing sports forums instead. Steve very much enjoys the creative process on the rare occasions when he does not completely hate the creative process. He is still waiting for the free snacks.

- title: Webmaster
  name: Tim Honeywell
  bio: |
    Tim Honeywell is a graduate, holding a dual major in Computer Science and Interactive Multimedia. He is one of the charter members of the club, but wasn't heavily involved until he started the GRACE project in Fall 2011. Tim is unapologetically interested in far too many subjects: AI, graphics, music, game theory, efficiency, and human-computer interaction. He may not be an expert in anything, but he knows how to bring the experts together and get them to make pretty things.
