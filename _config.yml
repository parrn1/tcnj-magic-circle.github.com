- title: Vice President
  name: Bobby Canciello
  bio: |
    Bobby Canciello is a senior Interactive Multimedia major/Digital Art minor. An original charter member, his love for game design was awakened upon attending his first Global Game Jam in 2011. Considering himself neither pure artist nor programmer, he prefers to walk the line between the two, using his interpersonal and managerial skills to efficiently lead and solidify a group. Though his passion lies in environment creation, he loves nothing more than being in the thick of productionâ€”brainstorming mechanics, modeling assets, generating design documents, and guiding a swarm of creative possibilities into one cohesive vision.

- title: Publicist
  name: Steve Boyland
  bio: |
    After stumbling into the very first Magic Circle meeting in Spring 2010 expecting free snacks (there were none), Steve has despite all odds stuck around to become the club Publicist for the second year in a row. A graphic designer and artist by trade, Steve keeps busy not doing any of that and browsing sports forums instead. Steve very much enjoys the creative process on the rare occasions when he does not completely hate the creative process. He is still waiting for the free snacks.

- title: Webmaster
  name: Tim Honeywell
  bio: |
    Tim Honeywell is a senior pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Interactive Multimedia. He is one of the charter members of the club, but wasn't heavily involved until he started the GRACE project in fall 2011. Tim is unapologetically interested in far too many subjects: AI, graphics, music, game theory, efficiency, and human-computer interaction. He may not be an expert in anything, but he knows how to bring the experts together and get them to make pretty things.
