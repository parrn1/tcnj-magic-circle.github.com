An original charter member, his love for game design was awakened upon attending his first Global Game Jam in 2011. Considering himself neither pure artist nor programmer, he prefers to walk the line between the two, using his interpersonal and managerial skills to efficiently lead and solidify a group. Though his passion lies in environment creation, he loves nothing more than being in the thick of productionâ€”brainstorming mechanics, modeling assets, generating design documents, and guiding a swarm of creative possibilities into one cohesive vision.</p>"
